# 📈 Python Finance Lab
Welcome to my financial laboratory! This repository is a collection of my first financial analysis tools built with Python. 

The goal of these projects is to leverage data science to visualize market trends and compare asset performances.

## 📂 Included Projects:

### 1. 🆚 Asset Comparator (`Asset comparator.py`)
A powerful tool that compares two user-selected assets (e.g., AAPL vs. TSLA) and challenges them against the **S&P 500** market benchmark.
- **Tech Stack:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`), Pandas, Plotly.
- **Key Features:** - Cumulative return calculation (Normalizing assets to 0%).
    - Dynamic data cleaning (handling multi-index and NaN values).
    - Interactive dark-themed chart opened directly in your browser.

### 2. 📊 Interactive Stock Graph (`interactive stock graph.py`)
A detailed visualization tool for single-stock analysis.
- Includes interactive line charts and technical indicators.
- Designed for deep-dives into historical price actions.

### 3. 📉 Static Stock Graph (`static stock graph.py`)
My very first financial data visualization project using Matplotlib.
- Focuses on clean, static price trend analysis over a 2-year period.
